## What ?
![Ethics definition]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/ethics5.png)  

Ethics or moral philosophy is a branch of philosophy that involves systematizing, defending, and recommending concepts of right and wrong conduct.  
Ethics seeks to **resolve questions of human morality** by defining concepts such as good and evil, right and wrong, virtue and vice, justice and crime. As a field of intellectual inquiry, moral philosophy also is related to the fields of moral psychology, descriptive ethics, and value theory.

## Why ?
Almost any professional whose work impacts the public must abide by some sort of ethical code of conduct, Hippocratic Oath for example. **What about us ?**

### Software is everywhere
Imagine a life without software : 
* Phones don’t ring
* Cars don’t start
* Planes don’t fly
* Bombs don’t explode
* Money doesn’t change hands
* Electricity doesn’t get generated

Our civilization doesn’t quite realize how dependent it has become on software.   
We all spend a huge amount of hour on our computers, smartphones, cars each day.

### Software can hurt
Some examples of it :
* 2015, independent tests revealed that Volkswagen engineers programmed cars to cheat emissions standards
* 2016, U.S. presidential election - Facebook/Twitter Epidemic of fake news, and now is inextricably linked to
* 2018, [Boeing 737 Max crashes because of software problems](https://www.extremetech.com/extreme/289042-boeing-confirms-additional-problems-with-boeing-737-max-flight-controls)
* 2018 Cambridge Analytica’s : weaponization of personal user information

Social exclusion, various environmental impacts, ....

### Who is responsible ?
Most of developers don’t ultimately feel it’s their responsibility if unethical products go live.

Code doesn't kill people :
**Who does it ?**
* Product managers? 
* Shareholders? 
* CEOs?

> We can **play a huge role** in designing technology that supports human society by **designing software ethically**.

## How ?
Organize a workshop to create your team's oath.  
Ask the participants to think about their current and last projects - 5'
* Did they respect environment, human beings ?
* Did their clients respect their own ethic ?
* On which kind of projects they like to work on ?
* For who they want to work ?
* Which kind of environments ?
* With whom ?
* What do they enjoy in their work ?

Once this reflection is done, ask them to start creating an oath in group of 2 by using this template :
![With great power comes great responsibility]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/ethics6.png)

* Each pair presents theirs work - 5'/pair
* Assemble - 5'
* Finalization - 5'

Present your results to other teams.
