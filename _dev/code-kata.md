## What ?
A kata, or code kata, is defined as an exercise in programming which helps hone your skills through practice and repetition.

### Many kind of katas

#### Randori
The challenge is solved by coding pairs (driver and copilot)
* Everyone can help
* Each pair has a small (5 or 7 minutes) timebox
* At the end of the timebox :
    * Driver goes back to the audience
    * Copilot becomes driver
    * One of the audience step up to be copilot

#### Katas
A presenter shows how to solve the challenge from scratch (TDD, Baby steps).
* Each step must make sense to everyone
* People interrupt if they donâ€™t understand

It can help you to acquire new skills and connect to your peers.

## How ?
* Create a coding dojo in your company
    * a place where people can come and practice their skills

> A coding dojo is a place to learn and have fun while programming.

In a coding dojo you can organize what is called **coding katas**.
