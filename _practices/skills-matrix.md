## What ?
A skills matrix is a grid or **table that clearly and visibly illustrates the skills and competence held by individuals within a team**.
The aim is to help team members understand each otherâ€™s skills, abilities and ambitions.

## Why ?
Skills matrix will help you to answer those questions:  
* Which competences, skills and abilities are already in the team ?
* Which competencies, skills, and abilities do you possess that may not be relevant to the goal of the team ?
* Which competences and so forth would you like to achieve or learn from some of the other team members ?

Once you have answers to those questions you can :
* Define how to share people's knowledge
* Identify what are the missing skills that are needed to reach the goal of the team
* Measure the skills improvement of the team
