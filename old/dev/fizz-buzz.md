## What ?
Fizz buzz is a group word game for children to teach them division.  
Players take turns to count incrementally, replacing any number divisible by three with the word "fizz", and any number divisible by five with the word "buzz".

Fizz buzz (often spelled "FizzBuzz") has been used as an interview screening device for computer programmers.  Writing a program to output the first 100 FizzBuzz numbers is a trivial problem for any would-be computer programmer, so interviewers can easily sort out those with insufficient programming ability.

## Why ?
Starting by resolving a simple problem is a good way to start learning a new programming language.
It's always a good thing to learn new things ;-)

## How ?
* Select a programming language you do not know
    * [List of programming languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_programming_languages)
* Write a "Fizzbuzz" program in this language you do not know yet
