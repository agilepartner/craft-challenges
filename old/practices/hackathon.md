## What ?
> “A hackathon, is an event when programmers meet to do collaborative computer programming.”
Hackathons provide a venue for **self-expression and creativity through technology**.  

People with technical backgrounds come together, form teams around a problem or idea, and collaboratively code a unique solution from scratch — these generally take shape in the form of websites, mobile apps, and robots.

## Why ?
Hackathon is a really good tool to stimulate the creative and problem-solving juices of developers.  
The time limit in a hackathon forces participants to distil their visionary concepts down to actionable solutions.

Outsiders can bring a fresh perspective to business challenges, as well as give an outside-in view of products and organization.

The main benefits for you are :
* Learn new technical skills
* Create a sense of accomplishment
* Innovate
* Develop solving problems skills

## How ?
Initiate the organization of an internal hackathon :
* Find sponsors to organize the event
* Gather your colleagues
* Schedule it
* Make some noise about it (create the buzz)
