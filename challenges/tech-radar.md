## What is it ?
The tech radar has been created by Thoughtworks Technology Advisory Board, a diverse group of senior technology leaders from all over the ThoughtWorksâ€™ world. 
They meet regularly to discuss the technology strategy for ThoughtWorks and the technology trends that impact our industry. 
Technology and business move fast, so they release a new edition of the Radar every six months.
