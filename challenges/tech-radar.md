## What ?
The tech radar is an online publication created by Thoughtworks Technology Advisory Board, a diverse group of senior technology leaders from all over the ThoughtWorksâ€™ world.  
They meet regularly to discuss the technology strategy for ThoughtWorks and the **technology trends that impact our industry**.
Technology and business move fast, so they release a new edition of the Radar every six months.

## Why ?
> We love to learn a lot of things and we want to be up to date, but unfortunately our cognitive resources are not infinite. That's why we need to organize our technology watch.
Creating your own radar is a good way to do so.

You can use it for many purposes :
* Organize your technology watch
* Align people on the usage of certain technologies inside your company
  * Know what is used by whom at the moment
  * Manage your technical debts (usage of VB for example)
  * Prepare the technology future of the company
  * Help to decide which technology shoud be tested in the next few weeks/months

## How ?
* Organize a workshop about structuring your technology watch
* Let people list :
  * Languages & frameworks
  * Tools
  * Platforms
  * Techniques  

The ones they are `using at the moment and the ones they would like to use in the future`.
