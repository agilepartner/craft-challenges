## What ?
Product review or sprint review (in a framework like scrum) is a dedicated meeting to gather feedback on the product that a self-organized team is working on.   

## Why ?
To produce the fitted product we need to `continuously acquire feedback and adapt our plans accordingly`.  
Those feedback can dramatically influence what will be worked on in subsequent weeks.  

## How ?
* Gather your Product Owner/stakeholders/everyone interested in the product
* Demonstrate the new functionalities that have been done
* Gather people's feedback
