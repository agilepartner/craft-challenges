# Create a new card
![Create a new card](images/create-a-new-card.png)  

## What ?
Because each context is different we didn't necessarily get to put everything on our cards.  
So, **if you really care about a topic, don't hesitate to create new cards**.

## Why ?
Spreading your priority topic in your company is really important and symbolizes the importance you bring to your job/passion and sharing.

## How ?
- Brainstorm in order to find topics that are not covered by our cards
- Use one of our template (in the resources below)
- Share your card (inside your company, on twitter, ...)
