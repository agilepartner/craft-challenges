# Facilitate a retrospective
![Facilitate retrospective](images/retrospective.png)  

An Agile retrospective is a meeting that's held at the end of an iteration. During the retrospective, the team reflects on what happened in the iteration and identifies actions for improvement going forward.

* Gather your team
* Focus on the process improvement
  * What **worked well** for us?
  * What **did not work well** for us?
  * What actions can we take to improve our process going forward?
* Facilitate the retrospective using those 5 steps
  *  Set the stage : Regardless of what we discover, we understand that everyone did the best job he or she could.
  * Gather data : What went well and what did not.
  * Generate insights : Teams typically identify why things happened and what should be done more, done less and tried out.
  * Decide what to do : Deciding on specific, meaningful, agreed and realistic actions that will be done in the next Sprint
  * Close the retrospective

## DO NOT USE ANTI-PATTERNS
* What happens in retro, does not stay in retro
* Change the world
* No time to improve
* No responsibility is taken (The scrum master will do it)
* Wishful thinking actions
* Managers want to attend
* One man show
* No review of past action items
