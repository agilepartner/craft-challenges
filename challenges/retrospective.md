## What ?
An Agile retrospective is a meeting that's held at the end of an iteration.  
During the retrospective, **the team reflects on what happened in the iteration and identifies actions for improvement** going forward.

## Why ?
> As software craftsmen we always want to improve, so it is very important to be able to facilitate this kind of meetings.

## How ?
* Gather your team
* Focus on the process improvement
  * What **worked well** for us?
  * What **did not work well** for us?
  * What **actions** can we take **to improve** our process going forward?

### Facilitate the retrospective using those 5 steps
  *  **Set the stage**
      * Regardless of what we discover, we understand that everyone did the best job he or she could.
  * **Gather data**
      * What went well and what did not.
  * **Generate insights**
      * Teams typically identify why things happened and what should be done more, done less and tried out.
  * **Decide what to do**
      * Deciding on specific, meaningful, agreed and realistic actions that will be done in the next Sprint
  * **Close the retrospective**
