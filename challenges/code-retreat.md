# Code retreat
![Code retreat](images/code-retreat.png)  

## What ?
A CodeRetreat is an intensive practice event, focusing on the fundamentals of software development and design. 
It gives the opportunity to practice TDD, Clean Code, Refactoring, ... 

## Why ?
As we want to be better developers, we need to learn continuously.
Because we are not humanoids; our **cognitive resources are limited** and we are not able to multitask, so we need to dedicate time for it. 
Doing a code retreat is a very good way to stay focused and improve our performance.

## How ?
- Turn off your notifications for the next 4 hours :
    - No emails
    - No smartphone
- Choose a topic you want to discover or improve
- Deep dive into it

> ### Turning off notifications enables focus on what you prioritize.
