## What ?
 Test-driven development (TDD) is a software development process that relies on the repetition of a very short development cycle :
 * Requirements are turned into very specific test cases
 * The software is improved to pass the new tests only.

## Why ?
By practicing T.D.D it will :
* Help you to **write only the amount of code required** to implement a functionnality
* **Improve the quality of your code** : you will read it like poetry
* Force you to have a direction in mind before you start charging into the fray, and having a direction in mind leads to **better design**
* **Focus you on the value** : 100% of testing the wrong things is not a goalâ€¦
* Improve your **productivity**

## How ?
* Start to work on a new functionality
* Think about your tests first
* Write your tests and your implementation through T.D.D
* Share with your teammates about your experimentation

### TDD cycle  
1) Add a test  
2) Run all tests and see if the new one fails  
3) Write some production code  
4) Run tests  
5) Refactor code  
6) Repeat
