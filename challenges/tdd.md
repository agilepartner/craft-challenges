## What is Test Driven Development ?
`Test-driven development (TDD) is a software development process that relies on the repetition of a very short development cycle: Requirements are turned into very specific test cases, then the software is improved to pass the new tests, only.`

### TDD steps  
* Add a test  
* Run all tests and see if the new one fails  
* Write some code  
* Run tests  
* Refactor code  
* Repeat
