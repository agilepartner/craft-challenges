## What ?
Docker is a tool designed to make it easier to create, deploy, and run applications by using containers.  
Containers allow a developer to package up an application with all of the parts it needs, such as libraries and other dependencies, and ship it all out as one package.

By doing so, thanks to the container, the developer can rest assured that the application will run on any other Linux machine regardless of any customized settings that machine might have that could differ from the machine used for writing and testing the code.

## Why ?
Using Docker has a lot of benefits amongst them :  

### Consistency
Docker provides a consistent environment for your application **from development all the way through production** — you run from the same starting point every time.

### Speed
You can rapidly run a new process on a server. Because the image is preconfigured and installed with the process you want to run, it takes the challenge of running a process out of the equation.

### Isolation
By default each Docker container that’s running is isolated from the network, the file system and other running processes.
