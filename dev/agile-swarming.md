## What ?
Every team member works on the same user story/product backlog item/feature at the same time.

## Why ?
Starting to implement a new feature with this approach helps to align everyone on how to deliver it.  
It can dramatically improve :
* Your architecture
* The naming in your code

> Basically it can save you a lot of time.

## How ?
Start a user story development in an "agile swarming" way.
* Start with a design session
    * Talk about the story
    * Split it
    * Reach an agreement on how to
        * Implement it
        * Name things
* Put TODOs in your code
* Distribute the TODOs in the team

### Puzzle Driven Development
PDD, or Puzzle Driven Development, is a method used to break down programming tasks into smaller ones and enable their implementation in parallel.  
Basically in group :
* Create skeleton of the implementation
* Put TODOs in the code
