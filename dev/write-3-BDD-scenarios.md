## What is Behavior Driven Development
Behaviour Driven Development (BDD) is a synthesis and refinement of practices stemming from Test Driven Development (TDD) and Acceptance Test Driven Development (ATDD).  
BDD augments TDD and ATDD with the following tactics:  
* Implement only those behaviors which contribute most directly to these business outcomes, so as to minimize waste
* Describe behaviors in a single notation which is directly accessible to domain experts, testers and developers, so as to improve communication (mostly Gherkin syntax)

## Use examples to describe specifications is powerful
`Examples are easier to understand and harder to misinterpret.`

Use Gherkin syntax to do so.
