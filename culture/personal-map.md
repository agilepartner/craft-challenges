## What ?
When you communicate with many people, it can be difficult to remember every little detail. A way to deal with this amount of information is to build mind maps about personal facts to remember details quickly.  
A mind-map is a visual and structured representation of information.
In Management 3.0, this kind of mind map is called a Personal Map.

## Why ?
People should get closer to the work of others in order to better understand what is going on.  
They can do this by :
* Moving their feet
* Moving their desk
* Moving their microphone

Decreasing the distance of yourself to others helps to increase communication and creativity.

> *A great exercise for a better understanding of people is to capture what you know about them in personal maps.*

## How ?
> *By creating a personal map of a colleague, you make an effort to better understand that person.*

In your team, explain the exercise as follows:
* Explain the purpose and how to create a personal map
* Use a template - like defined below
* Allow a time-slot - 10 minutes for example
* Instruct to write clearly and briefly
* Put all the personal maps on the wall
* Let each person take a personal map (but not his own!)
* Each person introduce the selected map to the others
* Continue until each personal map has been presented

Keep in mind that these personal maps are **not a one-time exercise**, these evolve as life continues!
