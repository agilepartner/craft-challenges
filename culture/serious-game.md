## What ?
Serious games are interesting tools to acquire knowledge, both for their motivational effect and the pedagogical principles they include such as a user-centred approach, interactivity, repetition, and continuous feedback.

## Why ?
> Serious game = **Learning by doing**

## How ?
* Find a topic you want to push inside your company (testing, communication issues, lean startup,continuous improvement, ...)
* Find a serious game related to the topic
* Organize a session with your colleagues
* Prepare yourself to facilitate the game
* Play the game
* Debrief the game with all the participants
* Provide feedbacks to the creators of the game

### Steps to debrief a game
As a facilitator you need to follow those 5 steps in order to make the debrief efficient.
1) FEELING  
**Let the participants talk**
* How did you feel during the exercise ?
* What did you feel ?
2) PROOFREADING  
After the feeling, **gather the facts**.
* What happened ?
* How did it go ?
* What difficulties have emerged ? When ?
3) LEARNINGS  
Participants try to **theorize** their experience.
* What did you learn ?
* What did you become aware of during this game ?
* What would you have changed to reach a better result ?
4) CONTEXTUALIZATION  
Participants must try to **transpose it to their cur professional context**.
* What parallel could you do with your professional context ?
* Have you had a sense of "déjà vu" ?
* What is your interest in your work or your daily life ?
* Did it seem realistic / exaggerated, why ?
5) KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER  
**Deliver theoretical insight** and evoke all the lessons that can be learned from the game.

> At the end, demonstrate that the game is a formidable weapon!!!
