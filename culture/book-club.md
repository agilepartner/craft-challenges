## What ?
A book club is a reading group, usually consisting of a number of people who `read and share about books based on a topic or an agreed-upon reading list`.  
It's common for book clubs to choose a specific book to read and discuss at the same time. 
Formal book clubs meet on a regular basis at a set location.  
Most book clubs meet monthly in order to give members time to read the next book.

## Why ?
> Because you will learn a lot and it is not the only benefit :
* You'll have the opportunity to read more books
* You can make new friends
    * Create empathy between colleagues
    * Meet new people
* You could set the tone of your own club
* It will help you diversify your reading list
* You will have the chance to share about books with other passionate guys
* It's a place to debate about something other than politics

## How ? 
* Create a book club in your company (if needed)
* Organize a monthly session
* Choose a book
    * The one you really want to read
    * Introduce the book during the next session
    * Each participant can introduce his/her book during each session
    * Vote for the more interesting one
* Share about the book during the next session
