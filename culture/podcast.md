## What ?
A podcast or generically netcast, is **an episodic series of digital audio or video files which a user can download and listen to**.  
It is often available for subscription, so that new episodes are automatically downloaded via web syndication to the user's own local computer, mobile application, or portable media player.  

## Why ?
> Because we don't know what we don't know.  

Podcast is a good way to learn new stuff during boring activities such as driving or gym.

## How ?
* Subscribe to a podcast (maybe one listed below...).
* Listen the latest one.
* Debrief with your colleagues about what you learned.
