## What
A video session is a group session where attendees watch videos all together.

## Why ?
It helps to share and discuss about any subject.  
Everyone can share his/her passion/discoveries.

> Don't limit yourself to tech videos, **be open minded**.

Watching videos in group will help you to create a culture of learning in your company.

## How ?
* Each attendee chooses a video about any topic of his/her choice
* Each attendee proposes a video to others
* All attendees vote for the video he/she really wants to watch
* Watch the first video based on the result of the vote
* Share what you have heard/seen/learned during this video
* Repeat and watch as many videos as you want
