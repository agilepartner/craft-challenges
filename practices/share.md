> ### Don't forget : in the agile world we strongly believe in *"Individuals and interactions over processes and tools"*.

Agile frameworks and methods provide multiple opportunities for stakeholder and team engagement – before, during, and after each iteration.

By involving the client in every step of the project, there is a **high degree of collaboration** between the client and delivery team, providing more opportunities for the team to **truly understand the client’s vision**. 

By connecting with your customers you will increase trust in and outside the team everyone will be more deeply engaged in the project.
