## What ?
Mob Programming is a software development approach where the **whole team works on the same thing, at the same time, in the same space, and at the same computer**.  
In addition to coding, teams practicing Mob Programming works together on almost all the work of a typical software development team including :
* Defining stories
* Working with customers
* Designing
* Testing
* Deploying software.

The team consists of everyone involved in creating the software, including customers.

The Mob Programming approach relies on concepts such as face-to-face and side-by-side communication, team alignment, collaboration, whole team involvement, continuous code review, and self-organizing teams in order to be effective.

> "Resolve complex problems in whole team"

## Why ?
The collaborative nature of Mob Programming causes many problems that software development teams generally face to “fade away.”  
It solves :
* Communication problems : eliminated by the collaborative face-to-face nature of communication in Mob Programming
* Decision making problems such as reluctance to make decisions and the need to defend decisions that are made
* Technical Debt : many sets of eyes on the current workit dramatically reduces the chances of many types of technical debt
* Focus problems : the team can continue on even if one team member is asked to switch contexts.
* Politics at the individual developer leve : Mob programming reinforces the work of the team and encourages people to figure out how they are best suited to help the team
* Collective ownership : because the entire team works on the same story at the same time it reinforces the collective ownership feeling

## How ?
* Gather your team
* Schedule a meeting with your Product Owner
* Start to implement an user story
    * From designing to DONE

### Rules
 * Use one keyboard and screen
 * Use a private room
 * Select a time keeper to rotate every 15 or 30 minutes
 * Everyone gets time at the keyboard
 *  Take a story from start to finish
 * Take breaks when you want
