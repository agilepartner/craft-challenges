## What is it ?
Pair programming consists of two programmers sharing a single workstation.  
There are 2 roles in pair programming :

#### Driver
The programmer at the keyboard is called the Driver.

#### Navigator
The other is called the Navigator.  
He is involved in the programming task by focusing more on overall direction.

## Benefits
* **Better code**  
"Programming out loud" leads to clearer articulation of the complexities and hidden details in coding tasks, reducing the risk of error or going down blind alleys.
* **Mentoring/Knowledge sharing/Shared understanding**  
Everyone, even junior programmers, has knowledge that others don't. Pair programming is a painless way of spreading that knowledge.
* **Improved morale**  
Pair programming, done well, is much more enjoyable than programming alone, done well.
* **Collective code ownership**  
When everyone on a project is pair programming, and pairs rotate frequently, everybody gains a working knowledge of the entire codebase.
* **Improve team coordination**  
There are N/2 pairs to coordinate instead of N individual developers.
