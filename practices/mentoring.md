## The M.E.N.T.O.R model
If you want to succeed in a mentoring relationship we recommend to follow the principles explained in the M.E.N.T.O.R model (explained in the book *"One minute mentoring"* by Ken Blanchard and Claire Diaz-Ortiz)

| Topic | Take action | Sound bite | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **M**ission | Essential to : <br/>• Create a vision<br/>• Purpose<br/>For the future mentoring partnership | First step in any relationship = **have a clear mission statement** | • Find a mentor who shares your key values<br/>• Approach a prospective mentor or mentee with courtesy / respect<br/>• Develop a short mission statement to set your intention and direct the relationship<br/>• Mentoring adds value on both sides (Mentees have knowledge and ideas to offer mentors as well)
| **E**ngagement | Agree on ways to engage that work for your :<br/>• Personalities<br/>• Schedule | Make a **commitment on regular meetings** | • Determine the type of engagement that works best for your personalities <br/> - Is your mentor / mentoree an extrovert / introvert ?<br/>- Are they best with set times scheduled far in advance ?<br/>• Mentoring partnerships require both :<br/>- Flexibility to engage in digital communication<br/> - The power in-person meetings when possible |
| **N**etworking | Expand your network with that of your mentor or mentee. | Cultivating productive relationships is a major key to success | • Networking is a **two-way street**<br/>- Your mentor can broaden your connections<br/>• Tread carefully on the network of your mentoring partner<br/>• Mentoring is also 1 to many connections (Social media for example) |
| **T**rust | Build and maintain trust by : <br/>• Telling the truth<br/>• Staying connected | **Building trust takes time -> can be destroyed in an instant** | • Trust should deepen <br/>• Honesty and clear communication with your mentoring partner can deepen trust and take your relationship to the next level |
| **O**pportunity | **Create opportunity for your mentoree or mentor to grow** | As partners you have access to personal and business opportunities | • Mentoring partnership is a two way street (Both have opportunities to bring)<br/>• Mentoring between generations (cross generational mentoring)<br/>-A powerful way to create opportunities by exchanging |
| **R**eview and Renewal | **Schedule a regular time to**<br/>• Review progress<br/>• Renew your mentoring partnership | You'll never get where you want if you don't create a mission statement and you'll never know you've arrived if you don't do regular reviews. | • Scheduling a regular review keeps both mentor and mentee on track <br/>• Ensure that reviews take place by putting them into your calendar<br/>• If your review reveals that the mission has not been accomplished -> discuss new strategies to achieve the goal |
