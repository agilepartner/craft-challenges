* Make at least 1 pull request / day 
* Do it during the next 4 days at least

> ### Pull requests will allow you to do pair reviews in your team.

## What is it ?
Pull requests let you tell others about changes you've pushed to a git repository.  
Once a pull request is opened, you can **discuss and review the potential changes** with collaborators and add follow-up commits before the changes are merged into the repository.

## How to 
Create a pull request to propose and collaborate on changes to a repository.  
These changes are proposed in a branch, which ensures that the master branch only contains finished and approved work.
